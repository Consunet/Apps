Native support has been removed for Opera and PhantomJS as the WebDriver implementations for these browsers are no longer under active development.
For Opera, users should be able to simply rely on testing Chrome as the Opera browser is based on Chromium (and the operadriver was a thin wrapper around chromedriver). For PhantomJS, users should use Chrome or Firefox in headless mode (see example/headless.js)

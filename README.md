Consunet / Apps
====
The source code for Consunet _EveryPass_ and _WhisperNote_ is now available.

Each of the subdirectories represents a seprate Netbeans project. The projects use Grunt to build independently from the Netbeans IDE.

If you just want to download a built copy, you can always find the latest release at https://www.consunet.com.au/products/

Hope you find this useful :-)
